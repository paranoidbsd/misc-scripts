update_source
=============

Simple script I use to update my FreeBSD source
tree via subversion.

If the revision after the update is different from
the revision before, it pulls the commit logs and
displays them via PAGER.

Nothing fancy but quite handy if you track HEAD and
like to read commit logs.

Too trivial for copyright.
